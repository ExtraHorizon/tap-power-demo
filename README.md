# Tap Power
This is an example Extra Horizon application which 
1. Measures how fast you can tap on a screen in 30 seconds
2. Sends measurement to the Extra Horizon backend 
3. Processes the measurement and generates some statistics from it
4. Visualizes the result in a progressive web application

The repository contains the following directories:
* `schemas`: These are the data schemas used by the backend.
    * `TapPowerMeasurements`: the measurements which are sent to the backend by the web application.
    * `TapPowerAnalysis`: the analysis which is generated by the ProcessTapMeasurements task running in the Extra Horizon backend.
* `tasks`: The application tasks. There's just one, `ProcessTapMeasurements`. This task is triggered whenever a TapPowerMeasurements document is created. That document is processed and a TapPowerAnalysis document is generated, which can be read by the web application.
* `pwa`: The React web application, which is hosted on Github Pages.

The best way to manage this repository is using the [ExH CLI tool](https://github.com/ExtraHorizon/exh-cli), provided you have the credentials to access the ExH sandbox environment.
